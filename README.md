# ui-SelectGenerator README

This is a super simple code snippet extension to provide a common [ui-select](https://angular-ui.github.io/ui-select/) implementation in html files.

## Features

simply begin typing \"<ui-select\" on any page where the file type is specified as html. I opted to not include the leading \"<\" bracket due to issues with intelisense.

this same behavior can be done without the extension in vsCode as explained [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets)


## Requirements

none

## How to install. 

If there's any demand, I'll look into publishing this to the vscode marketplace. However, at the moment the extension is light enough to simply clone it's contents locally and drop the whole contents into your vscode extensions folder as explained [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/example-hello-world#_installing-your-extension-locally).
